  "history": "The My Son temple complex was built over a period of ten centuries, from the 4th to the 14th century CE. It served as the religious and political capital of the Champa Kingdom, which ruled central and southern Vietnam for over 1,500 years. The temples were dedicated to the worship of the Hindu god Shiva, known to the Cham people as Po Nagar. The site contains the longest inhabited archaeological remains in Indochina, with evidence of continuous religious practices spanning multiple dynasties. During the Vietnam War, many structures were damaged by bombing, but restoration efforts have preserved this invaluable cultural heritage for future generations.",
